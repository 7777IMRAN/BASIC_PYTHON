    "1. To do multi threading import threading.\n",
    "2. thread: thread means task done by processor.\n",
    "3. single threading: when proccessor is able to do only one task at a time then it is single threading.\n",
    "4. multi threading: when proccessor is able to to do multiple task at a time then it is multi threading.\n",
    "5. NOTE: executing several tasks at a time is called multi tasking.\n",
    "\n",
    "types of multi tasking:\n",
    "there are 2 types:\n",
    "1. process based:\n",
    "    . executing sevaral tasks simultaneously where each task is separate and imdependent process.\n",
    "    ex: running chrome, MSword,MXPlaye;r at a time.\n",
    "2. thread based:\n",
    "    . executing sevaral tasks simultaneously where each task is separate independent but belonging of one single program is called thread based multi tasking\n",
    "\n",
    "ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "1. main advantage is it will utilize process time.\n",
    "2. improves performance by reducing response time.\n",
    "3. process management can be achieved more effectively.\n",

    "APPLICATIONS:\n",
